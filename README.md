# cybersec-educational-tools
This is a scoring engine for the Ubuntu OS in the vein of the scoring engine from the CyberPatriot competition. It checks to see if a student has found vulnerabilities on the system and provides real-time feedback. 

For example, the scoring engine will reward points to the student if they turn on the firewall. This allows students to gain hands-on experience at securing everything from web servers to standalone workstations. 

## How it works:
The teacher implements a list of vulnerabilities on a virtual machine and records them in `engine.py`, which will run every 30 seconds. As the student secures the system, the scoring engine will update `Template.html` to display a list of the vulnerabilites that the student found correctly. The student is finished when they reach all 100 points or when the teacher calls time. 

#### Instructions

    On the desktop, create a file called "Set Name for Scoring Report" and inside, write the exact words YOUR FULL NAME: [id]
    mkdir /opt/temp and then copy cp_logo.jpeg, tts.jpg, engine.py, Template.html, time.txt into /opt/temp/ a) Make sure the permissions on /opt/temp and the contents inside are owned by the standard user that the competitor is intended to use(not root or anyone else). Make /opt/temp readable to that standard user: chmod u+r /opt/temp/* /opt/temp
    install python2 (yes this runs in python2 NOT python3), python-pip, git
    pip install requests (and any other libraries needed by engine.py)
    forensics questions are to be named in the following format: "/home/[username]/Desktop/Forensics_[#]” ex: /home/mando/Desktop/Forensics_1
    in engine.py, change the variables imageName, imageUserName to whatever you want
    note: for users who are intended to have poor passwords, create them using useradd instead of adduser ex: if points are to be awarded for changing the password of user bob, create the user bob using useradd rather than adduser
    note: AVOID USING SPACES IN ANY FILENAMES. ex: make a “this_is_a_vuln.mp3” instead of “this is a vuln.mp3”
    input any vulns using vulns.append([specific vuln]). The template provides an example of how to do this
    compile the code using pyconcrete or cython

[pyconcrete guide](https://pypi.org/project/pyconcrete/)
```bash
git clone <pyconcrete repo> <pyconcre dir>	
```
install pyconcrete
```bash
python setup.py install
pyconcrete-admin.py compile --source=/opt/temp --pye
pyconcrete engine.pye
```
    keep the .pye file, but remove the .py files (once everything is tested). From this point on, the way to run the scoring engine will be pyconcrete engine.pye
    create a service for the scoring engine (instructions below)
    run the engine at least once to create ScoringReport.html and then create a symlink (ln -s /opt/temp/ScoringReport.html /home/$USER/Desktop/ScoringReport.html)
    important: CLEAR HISTORY, create aliases in /root/.bashrc and /home/$USER/.bashrc with the line export HISTFILE=/dev/null
    also very important: REMOVE engine.py FROM THE ENTIRE SYSTEM (ex: make sure it's not in your trashbin). Would defeat the point of compiling everything if the competitor can find the decompiled version somewhere with all the vulns

#### Setting up the scoring engine

create file /lib/systemd/system/engine.service add below into it

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Scoring Engine
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=root
ExecStart=(path to pyconcrete cmd) /opt/temp/engine.pye

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
#### Testing the scoring engine
```bash
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl enable engine
    reboot
    systemctl status engine
```
